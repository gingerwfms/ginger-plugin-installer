Ginger WfMS plugin installer
============================

The [Ginger Workflow Management System](https://github.com/gingerwfms/ginger-wfms) is a module driven system.
Each part is an own ZF2 module, with an associated github repo, a composer package and a travis-ci build.
The gingerwfms/ginger-plugin-installer is a core module, that installs other ginger plugins fetched by composer.
